# Youtube Video Downloader

The main purpose of this program is to make downloading videos from YouTube simple and fast, and for that reason I've decided to use two python modules, PyTube and Tkinter to achieve that. While creating this program I've learned some of the fundamental foundations of Tkinter and how to create a simple and straightforward GUI and applied it to the code for the sake of improving user experience.
